/**
 * Lifecycle thresholds — single source of truth for every timing constant
 * that drives terminal state detection and the pet's reactions.
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * Status detection lives in three layers that must agree: the PTY-level
 * runtime store (renderer), the telemetry service (main process), and the
 * session panel / pet event bridge (renderer UI). Before this file, each
 * layer pulled its thresholds from its own magic numbers; tuning one
 * without the others produced silent drift between "the pet thinks it's
 * idle" and "the panel says it's still working". Centralizing them:
 *   - makes every threshold discoverable in one place,
 *   - forces us to justify each number in prose,
 *   - makes the system tunable (future: hoist to user preferences).
 *
 * How to pick values
 * ------------------
 * Each constant below includes WHAT it controls, the rough WHY for the
 * current value, and a WHEN-TO-TUNE hint. If you're about to add a new
 * timing constant anywhere in the lifecycle stack, add it here first.
 *
 * Numbers are in milliseconds unless suffixed otherwise.
